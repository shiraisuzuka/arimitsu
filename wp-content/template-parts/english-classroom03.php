      <h2>pressure regulator structure</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The plunger pump operates by a motor at constant rotary speed regardless of pressure. Therefore, it is necessary to keep the fixed pressure by apparatus which adjust the pressure.</li>
        <li>When discharged water from a nozzle suddenly stopped, the pressure regulator is not only preventing the damage of a hose and the plunger pump but changing the pressure by reducing the strength of the spring, and it regulates the discharge volume and overflow volume.</li>
        <li>When the pressure in cylinder exceeds the maximum limited pressure, the disc is pushed up by the power of the spring. Then, the cleaning solution is discharged from overflow port and plunger pump can continue the operation.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>exhaust <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">pressure lever</span></h3>
        <p>The exhaust pressure lever maintains the pump pressure to nearly 0 during starting and stopping operation.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>overflow <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">port</span></h3>
        <p>The overflow port is used to return extra liquid to the tank.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>pressure <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">adjusting knob</span></h3>
        <p>The discharge pressure of the pump is controlled by pressure adjusting knob.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>spring</h3>
        <p>Giving the power between a disc and seat and adjusting the gap of them, it keeps the fixed pressure on cleaning solution that goes out of the pump.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>piston</h3>
        <p>The piston conveys the power of the spring to the disc. The piston prevents sounding (resonance) by using viscosity of the oil. As it shows an effect in proportion to the movement, It is able to make performance of pressure regulator in the best conditions.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>body</h3>
        <p>Put oil in a body. Please use ordinary engine oil or industrial general-purpose oil
          For warm water application, it most effective to use high viscosity oil.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>disk seat</h3>
        <p>We use high strength, corrosion and chemical resistance seat discs welded with high strength metal which are available in alumina, ruby disc and zirconia according to customer specifications.</p>

      <h2>features</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Volume efficiency is excellent by oil damper structure.</li>
        <li>It is easy to make the surface maintenance of the contact surface due to the adoption of the flat valve method.</li>
        <li>There is little trouble due to the simple structure. It is easy not only changing the parts but handling.</li>
