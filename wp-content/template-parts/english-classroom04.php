      <h2>the <span style="text-transform: lowercase;">function of unloader valve</span></h2>
      <p>The function of unloader valve.Fix an unloader valve like the chart below and set it for constant pressure.When the high pressure nozzle is opened, it becomes the<span class="u-color-blue">❶</span>direction.when the high pressure nozzle is closed, the pressure rises. and when it becomes higher than fixed pressure, the unloader valve start working. The flow changes in the direction of <span class="u-color-blue">❷</span>, and water/solution return to a tank through overflow hose.As for the pump, it runs under low pressure operation.</p>

      <p><span class="u-color-blue">❶</span>Set up the pressure of discharge water by closing the Pressure Adjusting Knob. It is pressurized from the entrance of discharge port. When the pressure exceeded the set up pressure, Direct operational relief valve is pushed up by water/solution and it becomes overflow water.When high pressure nozzle is closed, <span class="u-color-blue">❸</span>Check Valve closes. High pressurized water/solution goes through the passage <span class="u-color-blue">❷</span>and keep pushing up the piston <span class="u-color-blue">❹</span>. Then, unloader valve return water/solution through overflow hose. When high pressure nozzle is opened, the pressure in unloader valve goes down and piston<span class="u-color-blue">❹</span>comes down and unloader starts normal operation.</p>

      <h2>features</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Unloader valve has a same function as pressure regulator<br>When water shoot out from high pressure nozzle, it is different from the conventional unloader valve, and the pressure is adjustable. The conventional model is able to use only constant pressure with nozzle diameter and discharge volume, however, our unloader valve can adjust the pressure freely.</li>
        <li>It is smaller and lighter<br>By comparing with the conventional pressure regulator, it is designed in compact and it is smaller and lighter.</li>
        <li>Simple structure<br>The simple design of our unloader valve makes it easy to dismantle and replace parts.</li>
        <li>Durability
          <ul>
            <li>We use the ceramic ball disc which is strong against wearing out. Besides it reduces frictional resistance by spherical rotary structure and improves the durability.</li>
            <li>We use the material of seat in stainless steel and have made the economical type that both sides are exchangeable.</li>
